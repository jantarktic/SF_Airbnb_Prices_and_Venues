# SF_Airbnb_Prices_and_Venues
This is a study that compares Airbnb prices in neighbourhoods compared to the number of venues in different neighbourhoods in San Francisco. This comparison will aim to find the correlation between these to variables, as well as analysing the decline in Airbnb in these neighbourhoods over the passed year during the Coronavirus pandemic. The SF Airbnb Listings will be used and will be cleaned in order to show only SF neighbourhoods. The most recent average Airbnb prices will be used with the consideration of the current pandemic being taken into account. Because of this, data from 2018 and 2019 may provide a more accurate picture given that commercial real estate use in these cities play a big part into the success of the surrounding coffee shops. SF location data will also be used and clustered from the Foursquare API along with venue and profile information to determine the popularity of the office space.
